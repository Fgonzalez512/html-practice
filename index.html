        <h3>Cities I've lived in.</h3>
        <p>I was born in San Antonio so I lived there for a bit. I've wandered around a bit living with family which brought me to Chicago and Minneapolis. Austin was my choice for concerts and work.</p>

        <h3>Cities I want to visit.</h3>
        <p>I've always wanted to visit the Pacific Northwest and Seattle is the biggest city in the area. Ibiza has great music. Sydney has always seemed like a chill place and I want to see for myself</p>
